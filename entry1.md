Today I synthisized the informatioon from the past research that i have done throughout the weeks.

I learned that you can fork and clone things into your ide which really helped me  get everything together and know exactly what i am doing

I used the work we did in class and slides Ms.B has made avaliable to us

A skill that I used was synthesizing, research, and github/ ide
